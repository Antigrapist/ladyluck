<Paul Heaver> - Hi!
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Welcome Paul :)
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - How are you?
<Paul Heaver> - Good!  Congrats again on your win.
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Thank you
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - When is your first tournament coming up?
<Paul Heaver> - What is that craziness on the board? ")
<Paul Heaver> - Thursday
<Paul Heaver> - I have 8 events between 2/27 and 3/29
<Paul Heaver> - I probably won't make all of them, or my wife will kill me
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - :)
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Are they all the same region or are you region-crossing?
<Paul Heaver> - We're on the border.  THe Va-MD line is the region border.
<Paul Heaver> - I don't think it matters what region you win in though?
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Come to think of it, I suppose not
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - I didn't see any region markings on the certificate
<Paul Heaver> - Cool, good to know!
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - I should know better than to assume :)
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - So what are you up for tonight?
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Do you have a list in mind for THursday?
<Paul Heaver> - I can either do a swarm or my rebel worlds build (-rookie, +hwk).  I'm more likely to play the rebels for Thursday
<Paul Heaver> - Since I only own 3 TIE fighters. :)
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - haha
<Paul Heaver> - Once there's enough stuff for me to cross 100 bucks for free shipping, I'll pick up four more (and some netrunner and stuff)
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - I second Netrunner
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - I played in a few tournaments the past two weeks
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Fun stuff
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Much less stressful
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Due to a greater degree of control over the game state
<Paul Heaver> - It's a ton of fun.  There's only three or four near me I think.
<Paul Heaver> - I like the bluffing aspect of the game
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Same
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - You have played a bit then?
<Paul Heaver> - Yeah, back with the original set, and then I picked it up again on FFG's rerelease.  I went 6-6 at Worlds. :)
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Nice, same here.
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - If you like bluffing I have to tell you this
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - At the NR tournament yesterday
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - I forfeited my first corp draw and drew my second hand
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - I had 3/5 agendas
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - first auto draw I drew an agenda
<Paul Heaver> - of course
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - I managed to score 5 agenda points before he scored a single point
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - just by bluffing
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - he had 40 money at one point I think
<Paul Heaver> - geez
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - I did the same in several other games, a heavily iced remote
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - and I put out an agenda without ice
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - It's like no one can believe you would be so crazy so they don't even bother
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Great fun
<Paul Heaver> - Man, that should only work once. :)
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Indeed
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - So anyway, you'll fly your modified worlds build?
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Any preference on what I fly? It's more practice for you at this point
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Since your tournament is closer
<Paul Heaver> - because after that, your opponent is going to say, "can you believe what this guy did?" and you won't be able to do it for the rest of the day. :)  Sure.  I'll fly the mod-Worlds.
<Paul Heaver> - I don't particularly care what you run.  I expect to see a mix of everything.
<Paul Heaver> - no one in our meta tends to stick to any particular build.
<Deadshane> - where is your tourney paul?  Hope you guys don't mind me jumping on your conversation....
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - np here
<Paul Heaver> - no, it's fine.  Ashburn, VA on Thursday
<Paul Heaver> - Like 10min from my house
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - I'll do that other Biggs build then
<Paul Heaver> - ooh, the mirrorish match. :)

<Paul Heaver> - I don't think so, it's a store champ
<Paul Heaver> - also, you built that pre5.0, Jake?
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - yes
<Paul Heaver> - That explains the errors
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - looks like the base stats can still be modded so I think we are okay
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - just one second on the ID tagging
<Paul Heaver> - I'm still wondering what's up with that ORS, 2xBlue, A-Wing build you are playing around with. :)
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Oh, "Sensor Jammin'  "
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Block with ORS-APL and Proto
<Deadshane> - Variation on Rebel Convoy?
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - Jam the shots
<Paul Heaver> - With more punch and less ion
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - I've denied 12+ damage with SJ in a few matches
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - But AdvS and Kyle kills it
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - I'm at 100 points, you?
<Paul Heaver> - yeah, good thing Advanced Sensors is so rarely used mowadays </sarcasm>.  Yup, 100
<Paul Heaver> - so dice for eyeballs?
<Paul Heaver> - I love the setup box button they added in 5.0
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - most eyeballs picks?
<Paul Heaver> - sure
<Jake Pichelmeyer> - k, 3 attack each I guess?
<Paul Heaver> - ok
