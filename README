This is a simple script based on Paul Heaver's program dice die roll counter (see https://teamcovenant.com/pheaver/2013/10/22/vassal-die-roll-counter/)

It does a couple of things that Paul's program doesn't do: 1) it ignores UNDO die rolls and 2) it outputs expected values.

To use it, cut and paste the vassal chat window and place it in a file.  then run main.py --input_file=filename.  If you don't provide an input file it will default to log.txt.
